Dear Annalisa,<br>
I received 11.682,36 Euro for the invoice in relation to project ‘BCPM-cirrhosis regression’ from February.
Below is an overview over the hours worked since then and how much is left. I plan to update this file every month.

```{r echo = FALSE}
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(dplyr))
df <- readr::read_csv("2022-Arbeitszeit.csv", show_col_types = FALSE) %>%
  mutate(
    Month = factor(Month, levels = month.name, labels = month.name)
  )
```

```{r echo = FALSE}
makeOverall <- function(data, start = 11683, maxmonth = 4) {
  
  ms <- month.name[1:maxmonth]
  
  data %>% 
    filter(Month %in% ms) %>%
    group_by(Month) %>%
    summarise(
      Hours = sum(Hours),
      Compensation = sum(Compensation)
    ) %>%
    mutate(
      Total = cumsum(Compensation),
      Remaining = start - Total
    ) %>%
    knitr::kable(
      caption = "Overview over total monthly compensation and remaining budget"
    ) 
  
}
```

```{r echo = FALSE}
makeSingle <- function(data, month, project) {
  
  p <- data %>%
    filter(
      Project == project,
      Month == month
    )
  
  cap <- paste0("Project '", project, "' with ", p$With[1])
  
  p %>%
    select(Date, Task, Hours, Compensation) %>%
    arrange(Date) %>%
    mutate(Total = cumsum(Compensation)) %>%
    knitr::kable(
      caption = cap
    ) 
}
```


# Total Overview

```{r echo = FALSE}
makeOverall(df)
```

# January

```{r echo = FALSE}
makeSingle(df, "January", "Imaging analysis of Body Mass Composition")
```

# February

```{r echo = FALSE}
makeSingle(df, "February", "FIMADIA")
```

# March

```{r echo = FALSE}
makeSingle(df, "March", "FIMADIA")
```

# April

```{r echo = FALSE}
makeSingle(df, "April", "FIMADIA")
```
